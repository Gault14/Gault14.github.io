My GitHub account was created on September 24th, 2023 with the username Gault14.

The repository was created for CTI-110 at Wake Technical Community College.

Cloning the repository was as simple as opening GitHub desktop where it then had a selection of options, one of which was clone repository. From there I selected the repository I had made, set a destination, and it cloned it to my computer.
